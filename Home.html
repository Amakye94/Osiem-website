             Osiem is a historic town located in the Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Area in Ghana’s Eastern Region, under the authority of the Okyenhene (Paramount Chief of Okyeman). The town forms part of the great Akyem heritage — one of the key Akan states that have contributed immensely to Ghana’s cultural, political, and intellectual history.

The origins of Osiem date back to the early Asona clan migrations between the 14th and 17th centuries, when Akyem warriors and families established settlements across the fertile and forested lands of Okyeman. Osiem grew into a strategic community due to its location along major trade routes connecting Kyebi,Begoro, Tafo, Kukurantumi, and Koforidua. It became a center for trade, education, and cultural exchange in the region.

Geographically, Osiem lies close to the Atiwa Range Forest, one of Ghana’s most important ecological zones. The town’s lush environment has shaped its people’s identity, with a deep respect for nature and a strong sense of community.

Religiously, Osiem is notable for its Presbyterian tradition, which dates back to early missionary influence in Akyem Abuakwa. The town also celebrates rich Akyem customs and festivals, emphasizing unity, discipline, and cultural pride.
